# Technical RFC: Rate Limiting & Throttling Solution Based on Bucket4J and Redis

---

### Objective
To provide a robust, scalable, and production-ready rate limiting and throttling solution that can dynamically limit requests based on client IP, API key, or user. The RFC will outline both a naive implementation and a more sophisticated production-ready solution using the **Bucket4J** library and **Redis** for distributed token management. It will also discuss theoretical foundations, implementation steps, and how to scale the solution beyond IP-based limitations.

---

##  Problem Statement
Web services must control the rate at which clients can make requests to ensure system stability and prevent abuse. Without rate limiting, systems are vulnerable to performance degradation, security risks (DDoS attacks), and resource exhaustion.

---

## Theoretical Foundations: Rate Limiting and Token Buckets

### **Rate Limiting**:
Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a user, IP, or API key can make within a specific time window. The most common algorithms for rate limiting include:
1. **Fixed Window Counter**: Allows a fixed number of requests in a time window (e.g., 100 requests in 1 minute).
2. **Sliding Window Log**: Tracks individual requests and allows a fixed number of requests in a time window with more granular control.
3. **Token Bucket Algorithm**: Allows bursts of traffic, refilling a set number of tokens into a bucket at a regular interval. Requests consume tokens, and once the bucket is empty, the requests are rate-limited.

### **Token Bucket Theory**:
- **Bucket Size**: Defines the maximum number of tokens that the bucket can hold.
- **Token Refill Rate**: Defines how many tokens are added to the bucket per unit of time (e.g., 20 tokens per minute).
- **Request Consumption**: Each request consumes a token. If the bucket is empty, the request is denied until tokens are refilled.
- **Bursty Traffic**: The token bucket allows traffic bursts because tokens can accumulate when not used.

Example:
- **Bucket size**: 50 tokens.
- **Refill rate**: 20 tokens per minute.
- A user can send up to 50 requests instantly (if the bucket is full), and 20 additional requests after every minute.

##  Naive Solution: In-Memory Rate Limiting

### **Naive Implementation**:
A simple solution would store the request count for each client (based on IP address) in an in-memory map (`ConcurrentHashMap`). Each request increments the counter, and once the limit is reached, further requests are denied until a fixed time window elapses.

### **Code Example**:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class NaiveRateLimiter {
    private ConcurrentHashMap<String, Long> requestCounts = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    private final int MAX_REQUESTS = 100;
    private final long TIME_WINDOW = TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(1);

    public boolean isAllowed(String clientIp) {
        long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        requestCounts.putIfAbsent(clientIp, currentTime);
        long lastRequestTime = requestCounts.get(clientIp);

        if (currentTime - lastRequestTime > TIME_WINDOW) {
            requestCounts.put(clientIp, currentTime);
            return true; // reset window
        }
        return requestCounts.get(clientIp) <= MAX_REQUESTS;
    }
}
```

### **Naive Solution Drawbacks**:
- **Memory Limitations**: In-memory storage is limited to a single instance, and data is lost if the instance restarts.
- **No Scalability**: Cannot scale across multiple servers or instances (not suited for distributed systems).
- **No Granularity**: Lacks flexibility in terms of API key or user-based limiting.
- **Vulnerable to Bursts**: Does not handle burst traffic effectively.

## Production-Ready Solution: Using Bucket4J and Redis

### **Bucket4J + Redis**:
**Bucket4J** is a library that provides a token-bucket-based rate limiting implementation, and when integrated with **Redis**, it supports distributed rate limiting across multiple instances of an application.

### **How Bucket4J + Redis Works**:
1. **Bucket Configuration**: Define the bucket size and refill rate dynamically based on the API endpoint, HTTP method, or client attribute (IP, API key, or user).
2. **Token Consumption**: Each request consumes one token from the bucket.
3. **Redis Integration**: Redis stores the bucket state (remaining tokens, refill time), allowing multiple instances to share the same rate limit configuration.
4. **Scalability**: Distributed systems can share rate-limiting states, ensuring consistency across instances.
5. **Flexibility**: Rate limits can be set for different levelsâ€”IP-based, API key-based, or user-based.

### **Code Example**:

```java
import io.github.bucket4j.Bucket;
import io.github.bucket4j.BucketConfiguration;
import io.github.bucket4j.Bandwidth;
import io.github.bucket4j.distributed.proxy.ProxyManager;
import io.github.bucket4j.redis.lettuce.cas.LettuceBasedProxyManager;
import io.lettuce.core.RedisClient;
import io.lettuce.core.RedisURI;
import io.lettuce.core.api.StatefulRedisConnection;
import io.lettuce.core.codec.StringCodec;
import org.springframework.core.env.Environment;

import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

public class Bucket4JRateLimiter {

    private final ProxyManager<String> proxyManager;

    public Bucket4JRateLimiter(Environment environment) {
        RedisClient redisClient = RedisClient.create(RedisURI.builder().withHost("localhost").withPort(6379).build());
        StatefulRedisConnection<String, byte[]> redisConnection = redisClient.connect(StringCodec.UTF8, StringCodec.BYTE);
        this.proxyManager = LettuceBasedProxyManager.builderFor(redisConnection).build();
    }

    public Supplier<BucketConfiguration> bucketConfiguration(String endpoint, String method) {
        return () -> BucketConfiguration.builder()
                .addLimit(Bandwidth.simple(20, Duration.ofSeconds(60)))
                .build();
    }

    public boolean isAllowed(String clientIp, String endpoint, String method) {
        Bucket bucket = proxyManager.builder().build(clientIp + ":" + endpoint + ":" + method, bucketConfiguration(endpoint, method));
        return bucket.tryConsume(1);
    }
}
```

## Expanding Beyond IP-Based Limiting

While the above solutions are IP-based, we can expand the system to work with **API keys** or **users**. This would involve:

- **Identifying the Client**: Using the **API key** or **user ID** passed in the request header or parameters.
- **Generating the Key**: Instead of using `clientIp`, generate the Redis key based on the API key or user ID, i.e., `"rate_limit:" + apiKey + ":" + endpoint + ":" + httpMethod` or `"rate_limit:" + userId + ":" + endpoint + ":" + httpMethod`.
- **Flexible Configurations**: Different limits can be applied based on the type of user or API key (e.g., free-tier vs. premium users).

### **Code Example for API-Key-Based Limiting**:

```java
public boolean isAllowed(String apiKey, String endpoint, String method) {
    String key = "rate_limit:" + apiKey + ":" + endpoint + ":" + method;
    Bucket bucket = proxyManager.builder().build(key, bucketConfiguration(endpoint, method));
    return bucket.tryConsume(1);
}
```

## Steps to Make the Solution Robust and Production-Ready

1. **Dynamic Rate Limits**: Allow rate limits to be configurable per endpoint, API key, and user level (e.g., tiered limits).
2. **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrate comprehensive logging of rate limit hits and misses for analysis.
3. **Error Handling**: Return appropriate error responses (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests`) with retry headers.
4. **Graceful Throttling**: Implement throttling before completely denying requests to give clients a chance to slow down.
5. **API Key Support**: Add support for API key-based rate limiting.
6. **User-Based Limiting**: Implement rate limiting based on user IDs for better granularity.
7. **Rate-Limiting Policies**: Provide different rate-limiting policies for different APIs (e.g., higher limits for critical APIs).
8. **Security**: Protect rate-limiting configurations and ensure secure storage of API keys.
9. **Rate Limit Burst Window**: Allow bursty traffic by configuring refill rates and bucket sizes to manage spikes effectively.
10. **Retry Headers**: Include `Retry-After` headers to inform clients when they can retry.
11. **Global Rate Limit**: Implement a global rate limit across all endpoints to prevent overall system overload.
12. **Metrics Export**: Export rate-limiting metrics to monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana.
13. **Client-Based Exemptions**: Allow certain clients or services to bypass rate limits based on API key or role (e.g., internal services).
14. **Rate-Limiting Analytics**: Provide insights into how many requests are being rate-limited or throttled.
15. **Token Bucket Adaptation**: Dynamically adjust bucket sizes and refill rates based on real-time system load.
